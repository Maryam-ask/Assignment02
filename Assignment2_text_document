"why it is better that the lists represent columns instead of rows
(if you come to another conclusion, explain why it is better to treat them as rows)?"
Because in this game the inputs are from the columns numbers and it is easier to work with columns instead of the rows.
On the other hand the numbers of rows are depending on the length of the columns and also it's harder to implement.

"The provided minimax algorithm does not utilize a game node, how is this possible?"
In minimax algorithm we go through the states by choosing the minimum or maximum value of the moves, for each move
we get the value of the move and we chose the state by choosing the minimum or the maximum and first time we start from
maximum and next time is minimum until we reach the goal state then we go recursively back to the root state.
